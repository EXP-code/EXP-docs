   pyEXP-tutorial
   EXP-tutorial
   docker

These tutorials are based on the companion :index:`GitHub` EXP
repositories which you can clone to your working computer in the usual
way.  To get the pyEXP examples do:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   git clone git@github.com:EXP-code/pyEXP-examples.git pyEXP-examples

and to get the EXP N-body examples do:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:EXP-code/EXP-examples.git EXP-examples


.. note:: We use the ``Nbody`` example from ``EXP-examples`` to
	  illustrate some key features of pyEXP.  For pyEXP-only
	  users, we provide an abbreviated output set that may be
	  copied from ``EXP-examples/Nbody/data``.  In addition, for
	  those of you interested in *both* EXP and pyEXP, we
	  recommend studying the example in ``EXP-examples/Nbody`` as
	  a template for an astronomically relevant simulation.

Quick-start examples
--------------------

The following two tutorials are quick excerpts from the larger example
suite to get you started.

:doc:`pyEXP-tutorial`
    Your first pyEXP example project.

:doc:`EXP-tutorial`
    Your first EXP example project.

For a quick start up, consider using our Docker container which
requires no compilation.  See :ref:`Exploring EXP using Docker
<intro-docker-notes>` for an introduction.
