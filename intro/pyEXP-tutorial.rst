.. index:: sort: pyEXP; tutorial

The **Tutorials** section of the `pyEXP-examples
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ repository is designed
to be a standalone self-guided EXP course using Python.  At the bottom
of each notebook you will find a link to the next notebook in the
sequence.

We include the first two of the introductory tutorials from
**pyEXP-examples** below. These will give you the flavor of the
workflow and introduce the key pyEXP ideas.  Rather than read, we
strongly encourage you to run these yourself.

To get started, make sure that EXP is installed on your system (see
:ref:`intro-install`).  Then, you may use the copy button and paste
each cell into a local notebook.  Or, `git clone` the
**pyEXP-examples** repository from `here
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ and load the notebooks
into Jupyter in their entirety.  If you are using the EXP Docker
container, the **pyEXP-examples** repository can be copied or loaded
from `/usr/local/pyEXP-examples` in the container.

.. note::

   You will need the example `Data` directory from the
   **pyEXP-examples/Tutorials** directory do the computations in some
   of the cells in these notebooks.

Next steps
==========

These first two notebooks covered only the basics of pyEXP, but
there's a lot of other features not mentioned here.  If these seem
useful, we encourage you to work through the rest of the tutorial
notebooks in sequence.  Also, you can learn to run EXP n-body
simulations using the notebooks in the **Tutorials/EXP** directory.
