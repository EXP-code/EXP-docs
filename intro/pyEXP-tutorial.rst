.. index:: sort: pyEXP; tutorial

The **Tutorials** section of the `**pyEXP-examples**
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ repository is designed
to be a standalone self-guided EXP course.  At the bottom of each
notebook you will find a link to the next one in the sequence.

We include the first two of the introductory tutorials from
**pyEXP-examples** below. These will give you the flavor of the
workflow and introduce the key pyEXP ideas.  Rather than read, we
strongly encourage you to run these yourself.

To get started, make sure that EXP is installed on your system (see
:ref:`intro-install`).  Then, you may use the copy button and paste
each cell into a local notebook. Or, `git clone` the
**pyEXP-examples** repository from `here
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ and load the notebooks
into Jupyter in their entirety.  If you are using the EXP Docker
container, the **pyEXP-examples** repository can be copied from
`/usr/local` in the container.

features not mentioned here.
