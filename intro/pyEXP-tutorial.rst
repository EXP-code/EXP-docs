You will find the first two of the introductory tutorials from
**pyEXP-examples** below. These will give you the flavor of the
workflow.  Rather than read, we strongly encourage you to run these
yourself.

To get started, make sure that EXP is installed on your system (see
:ref:`intro-install`), `git clone` the **pyEXP-examples** repository
from `here <https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ If you are
using the Docker container, the **pyEXP-examples** repository can be
copied from `/usr/local` in the container.  The **Tutorials** section
of the **pyEXP-examples** repository are designed to be a standalone
self-guided EXP course.

This tutorial covered only the basics of pyEXP, but there's a lot of other
features not mentioned here.
