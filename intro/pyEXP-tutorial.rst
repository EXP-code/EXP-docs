pyEXP Tutorial

.. index:: sort: pyEXP; tutorial

The **Tutorials** section of the `pyEXP-examples
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ repository is designed
to be a standalone self-guided EXP course using Python.  At the bottom
of each notebook you will find a link to the next notebook in the
sequence.

We include the first two of the introductory tutorials from
**pyEXP-examples** below. These will give you the flavor of the
workflow and introduce the key pyEXP ideas.  Rather than read, we
strongly encourage you to run these yourself.

To get started, make sure that EXP is installed on your system (see
:ref:`intro-install`).  Then, you may use the copy button and paste
each cell into a local notebook. Or, `git clone` the
**pyEXP-examples** repository from `here
<https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples>`_ and load the notebooks
into Jupyter in their entirety.  If you are using the EXP Docker
container, the **pyEXP-examples** repository can be copied or loaded
from `/usr/local/pyEXP-examples` in the container.

Next steps
==========

These first two tutorials covered only the basics of pyEXP, but
there's a lot of other features not mentioned here.  We encourage you
to work through the rest of the tutorial in sequence.  You can also
learn to run EXP simulations.  We include notebooks that demonstrate
running simulations with EXP in the **EXP** directory of the
**Tutorials** repository.
