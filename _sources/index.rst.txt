EXP |version| documentation
===========================

EXP is a fast high-level C++ library with Python bindings for
performing and analyzing n-body simulations using biorthogonal and
orthogonal expansions, also known as *basis function expansions (BFE)*.
The library also supports time series analysis of expansion coefficients
using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (mSSA) to discover new
dynamical correlations, separate signal from noise, and visualize these
in two- and three-dimensional renderings.

There are two *entry points* into EXP:

1. The N-body code itself and Unix-style auxiliary utilities for
   manipulating and analyzing N-body phase space.
2. The Python interface to basis  C++ libraries used by the N-body
   code.  These are designed to enable your post-processing analyses
   on both EXP and other N-body simulation snapshots (Gadget, Gizmo,
   Arepo, etc.) within the Python/Jupyter ecosystem. The Python interface
   is the primary method for time series analyses.

In this documentation, **EXP** refers to the entire code base and
**pyEXP** refers to the Python EXP API.  Many users may only be
interested in pyEXP.  Since the basis function expansion concepts and
mathematics are the shared between EXP and pyEXP, we will describe
both together in this documentation.
