User modules
============

.. index: user modules; extending EXP; ExternalForce

Users may write modules that are found and loaded at run time.  One may
derive classes from `ExternalForce` that may be built as
dynamic modules that may be loaded and instantiated as needed.
Modules are built in the `src/user` directory.  This is
accomplished using dynamically loaded (DL) libraries that register
themselves on a list of `ExternalForce` instances that may be
instantiated as directed in your configuration file.  These new
modules have access to the entire phase space for each component.  It
is the user's responsibility to not change the phase space in
unphysical ways, of course.

We offer two strategies for incorporating your user modules into EXP:

1. Extend the `CMakeLists.txt` file in `src/user` to build and install
   your source in EXP.  You can keep your code private in a local
   branch or a fork.  This is described in :ref:`Extending
   <module_branch>` below.

2. Create a private git repository and use the submodule facility in
   git to build the source and install the source in EXP.  This is
   described in :ref:`Using a private repo <module_private>`.

Extending `src/user`
--------------------

.. _module_branch:


There are only a few steps necessary to put one's code in the tree:

1. Write the code (see below for additional details)

2. Edit `CMakeLists.txt`.  Assume you module is called
   `foo` and is implemented in the following source files
   `foo1.cc` and `foo2.cc`. Do the following:

   - Define a new source variable pointing to the source files in the
     `CMakeLists.txt`.  E.g.  `set(foo_SRC foo1.cc foo2.cc)`
    
3. Compile the code

4. Install the code in the location defined by your configuration


Notes on writing your module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good place to start is the code already in the `src/user`
directory. The simplest code is `UserTest.cc`; this does
nothing but print messages but illustrates all of the necessary
components.

All classes, of course, must derive from `ExternalForce`.  A quick
look at `src/ExternalForce.H` will show that you will need to
implement at least the member
`determine_acceleration_and_potential_thread()`.  In order to parse
command line parameters, you will also need a constructor and
`initialize()` and maybe a destructor.

In addition, there is a mechanism that identifies your new class to
EXP.  This has two parts.  First you must define a C
function which constructs an instance of your class and returns a
pointer. Using the C calling interface here gets around the problem of
name demangling in C++ in using the dynamic linking loader (there may
be a more transparent and portable way to do this).  You will notice
an additional class at the end of the file called `proxy`.  An
instance of this simple class is instantiated when the module is
loaded (the last line in the file).  As a byproduct, a pointer to the
function `makeTest()` is is added to the factory map defined in
`ExternalForce.H`.  This function can then be invoked by name
in the code to create an instance of your class.  Cute trick, eh?  You
can simply copy this to your own source (changing `makerTest`
to `makerFoo` or some other unique name).

Using a private repository for your modules
-------------------------------------------

.. _module_private:

The strategy above describes adding your module directly to the
`src/user` directory. With this workflow, you would keep a personal
branch and merge new changes from the `main` EXP branch as they become
available.

We support an additional strategy that allows you to work directly
from the `main` EXP repo without a private local branch or a fork.  In
this alternative scenario, you would make a private git repository,
either on your local machine or git server (e.g. GitHub) and install
your repository in the `extern/user-modules` directory.  This steps
for this are:

1. Copy `CMakeLists.txt` from `src/user` to your new git repository as
   a template.

2. Replace the existing module list and source strings with the
   source for your new module, just as in the instructions for Step 2
   at the top of this section.

3. `git clone` your repository into the `extern/user-modules`
   directory with your new `CMakeLists.txt` in the top level of the
   cloned repository.  You may include any number user module code
   directories into `extern/user-modules`.  Just remember to use
   unique names for each.
    
4. Now, when you build EXP, your private modules will be automatically
   built for each directory and installed.
