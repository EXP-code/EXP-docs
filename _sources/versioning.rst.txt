.. _versioning:

============================
Versioning and API stability
============================

What the version number means
=============================

.. index:: versioning

There are 3 numbers in a EXP version: *A.B.C*

* *A* is the major version. This will rarely change and will signify very
  large changes.
* *B* is the release number. This will include many changes including features
  and things that possibly break backward compatibility, although we strive to
  keep these cases at a minimum.
* *C* is the bugfix release number.  A bugfix release will not break
  backward compatibility, although it may add some (usually minor) new
  features.

Backward-incompatibilities are explicitly mentioned in the
:ref:`release notes <news>`, and may require special attention before
upgrading.

The latest version of EXP will always be the HEAD of the ``main``
branch.  EXP developers may use temporary branches for developing and
testing new features.  However, these should not be expected to work
until they are merged to ``main`` by a git pull request.  All users
outside of the EXP-code organization can contribute to development by
forking the code in GitHub and submitting git pull requests to the
main EXP branch based on their development branches.

For easy identification, the code maintainers will indicate a stable
version on the ``EXP-code/EXP`` web page under *Releases* in the
right-hand column of the `main` branch page.  A *release* refers to a
particular commit that the developers feels have no significant
unresolved issues.


API stability
=============

.. index:: API stability

We intend for the API to be stable in major versions and will try to
maintain stability and backward compatibility through major versions,
if possible.

Methods or functions that start with a single dash (``_``) are private and
should never be relied upon as stable.

Also, keep in mind that stable doesn't mean complete: stable APIs could grow
new methods or functionality but the existing methods should keep working the
same way.


.. _deprecation-policy:

Deprecation policy
==================

.. index:: deprecation

We aim to maintain support for deprecated EXP features for at least 1 year.

For example, if a feature is deprecated in a EXP version released on
June 15th 2020, that feature should continue to work in versions
released on June 14th 2021 or before that.

Any new EXP release after a year *may* remove support for that deprecated
feature.

All deprecated features removed in a EXP release are explicitly
mentioned in the :ref:`release notes <news>`.
